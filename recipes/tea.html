      <li>Black tea bag</li>

        <li>Fill kettle with water from tap</li>
        <li>Boil water in kettle</li>
        <li>Place tea bag in ceramic cup or cup of preference which can withstand the heat of the boiling water</li>
        <li>Pour boiling water into cup until it is around 3/4 full</li>
        <li>Stir the tea bag in the water and leave it to brew for a little while (<em>a few minutes</em>).
